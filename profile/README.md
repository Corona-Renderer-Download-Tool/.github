## 📌 About the Renderer
**Corona Renderer 12** is an artist-focused CPU path tracer for Windows. It delivers photoreal results with minimal setup, offering interactive rendering, physically based materials, smart denoising, and a streamlined tone-mapping pipeline that speeds up look-dev and final production.

## ❓ What is Corona Renderer 12?
A production-ready rendering engine built for simplicity and quality. Use physically correct lights and materials, iterate in real time, and finalize images with built-in tone mapping and LightMix—without leaving your DCC.

## ✅ Why Choose Corona?
- Fast, interactive CPU path tracing  
- Simple, physically based material/lighting workflow  
- LightMix for per-light relighting after render  
- Built-in tone mapping, LUTs, bloom & glare  
- Denoising options for cleaner results  
- Memory-efficient displacement and proxies  
- Stable renders for ArchViz, product, and design

## 🔧 Key Features
- Interactive Rendering (IR) for instant feedback  
- PBR material system with layered shaders  
- Physical camera controls and realistic lights  
- LightMix & post-FX stack inside the VFB  
- Denoisers (e.g., Intel Open Image / OptiX as available)  
- Caustics, volumetrics, and motion blur  
- Render passes, masks, and AOVs for comp  
- Network rendering support

---

## 🖥️ System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)  
- Modern Intel or AMD multi-core CPU (more cores = faster)  
- 8 GB RAM (16 GB+ recommended)  
- GPU optional (CPU-based renderer; GPU used for some denoisers)  
- Compatible DCC host (e.g., 3D application supporting Corona integration)

## ▶️ Usage
1. Install **Corona Renderer** on Windows.  
2. Launch your DCC and set **Corona** as the active renderer.  
3. Use PBR materials and physical lights; start **Interactive Rendering**.  
4. Adjust exposure/tone mapping and LightMix in the VFB.  
5. Render final frames and export AOVs for compositing.
